The CREDS IG relies on simple profiles to the StrucutreDefinition resource to require the type of definition and the mandatory mapping fields.  These are used to create logical models for the data flow.  These logical models are expressed as StructureDefinitions with the submitted data being a StructureDefinition with assigned values for the profiles to assign the data to in the resulting reporting bundle.

Additionally, the logical model shows the mappings for FHIR, CDA and/or HL7 V2 segments.  With no mappings, it is assumed that the data will need to be manually sourced from other systems or data exchange methods.
